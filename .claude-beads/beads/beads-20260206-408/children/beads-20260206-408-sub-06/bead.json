  "description": "Modify apps/web/src/components/layout/user-menu.tsx to add a 'My Household' DropdownMenuItem with a Lucide icon (Home or Users) that navigates to /household using TanStack Router Link component. Insert the item between the user info label and the Sign Out item, with Separators above and below. The menu structure becomes: [User Info Label] --- My Household --- Sign Out. Do NOT add any household-leaving logic here -- the 'Change Household' action lives exclusively on the household details page. Covers FR-18 (entry point to household page via user menu).",
