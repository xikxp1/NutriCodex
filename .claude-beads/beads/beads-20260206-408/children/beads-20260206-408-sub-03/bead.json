  "title": "Auth guard extension for household check",
  "description": "Modify apps/web/src/routes/_authenticated.tsx to add a two-step server-side check in beforeLoad: (1) authenticate via existing getAuth(), (2) check household membership via new getHouseholdStatus() createServerFn using fetchAuthQuery(api.households.getMyHousehold, {}). If authenticated but no household, redirect to /onboarding. The getHouseholdStatus server function uses fetchAuthQuery from ~/lib/auth-server.ts which handles authenticated server-side Convex queries. Covers FR-11, FR-21.",
