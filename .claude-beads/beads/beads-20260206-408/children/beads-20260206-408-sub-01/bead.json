  "description": "Add household and householdMember tables to packages/backend/convex/schema.ts with indexes (by_userId, by_householdId). Create packages/backend/convex/households.ts with all 7 Convex functions: queries (getMyHousehold, getHouseholdMembers, listHouseholds) and mutations (createHousehold, joinHousehold, leaveHousehold, updateHousehold). All functions validate authentication via authComponent.getAuthUser(ctx), enforce one-household-per-user constraint, validate name length (1-100 chars), and auto-delete empty households on leave. userId stored as v.string() since Better Auth tables are component-managed. Covers FR-01 through FR-10, NFR-01, NFR-02.",
