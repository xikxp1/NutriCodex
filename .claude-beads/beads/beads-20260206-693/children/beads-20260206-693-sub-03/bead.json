  "description": "Create apps/web/src/routes/login.tsx as a TanStack file route at /login. The route uses validateSearch to extract an optional 'redirect' search parameter (defaults to '/'). An optional beforeLoad checks auth via getAuth() server function and redirects authenticated users to '/'. The component renders a centered card (using ShadCN Card components) with: a heading ('Log in to NutriCodex'), email input with label, password input with label, a 'Log In' submit button with loading/disabled state during submission, an inline error message area, and a link to /signup preserving the redirect param. The form uses controlled React state (useState). On submit: call authClient.signIn.email({ email, password }) with onSuccess callback that navigates to the redirect param value, and onError that sets the error message. HTML5 required and type='email' attributes provide basic client-side validation. Covers US-2, FR-2, FR-6, FR-9, FR-11, FR-12, FR-15, FR-17, FR-18, UX-1, UX-3.",
