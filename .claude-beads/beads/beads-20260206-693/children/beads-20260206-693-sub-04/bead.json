  "description": "Create apps/web/src/routes/signup.tsx as a TanStack file route at /signup. The route uses validateSearch to extract an optional 'redirect' search parameter (defaults to '/'). An optional beforeLoad checks auth via getAuth() server function and redirects authenticated users to '/'. The component renders a centered card with: a heading ('Create your account'), name input with label, email input with label, password input with label, a 'Sign Up' submit button with loading/disabled state, an inline error message area, and a link to /login preserving the redirect param. The form uses controlled React state. On submit: call authClient.signUp.email({ name, email, password }) with onSuccess callback that navigates to the redirect param value, and onError that sets the error message. HTML5 required and type='email' attributes provide basic validation. Covers US-1, FR-1, FR-5, FR-7, FR-9, FR-11, FR-12, FR-16, FR-17, FR-18, UX-1, UX-4.",
