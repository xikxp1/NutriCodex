  "title": "Add Product Dialog -- OpenFoodFacts import",
  "description": "Implement OpenFoodFactsSearch component with debounced search input (300ms via @tanstack/pacer), paginated results display with Previous/Next navigation based on pageCount/page metadata, product cards showing name/brand/image/macros, and 'Import' button per result that calls the importProduct action (which downloads image server-side into Convex storage). Replace the Import tab placeholder in AddProductDialog with this component. Loading states for search and import operations. Success/error toasts via Sonner. Covers FR-17, FR-18, FR-23, NFR-2, NFR-8.",
