  "title": "Product Detail Dialog -- view/edit/delete",
  "description": "Implement ProductDetailDialog for viewing product details: name, image (from Convex storage), nutrition facts (calories, protein, carbs, fat as integers per 100g), source indicator (manual/openfoodfacts), barcode (if present). Implement ProductEditForm with TanStack Form + Zod validation, pre-populated with current values, image replace/remove support (3-step upload for new image, removeImage flag for deletion). Add delete button with ShadCN AlertDialog confirmation that calls deleteProduct mutation (which also removes stored image). Wire clicking a ProductRow in the product list to open the detail dialog. Success/error toasts for update and delete operations. Covers FR-19, FR-20, FR-21, FR-23, NFR-3.",
